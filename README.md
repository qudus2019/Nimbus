## My process
I started by writing the HTML code before styling with CSS. Designed for desktop first before adding the media query for mobile.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Media Query
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Practiced and perfected the use of media queries and other CSS properties.

A code snippet i am proud of:

```css
/*for mobile*/
@media screen and (min-width:375px) and (max-width:480px)
}
```


### Continued development

Continue the practice of styling using CSS and creating responsive layouts
### Useful resources

- w3schools.com - Got all the CSS references i needed from there.
